When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. “The Amateur” is directed by James Hawes. The screenplay is by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli based on the novel by Robert Littell. The film is produced by Hutch Parker, p.g.a., Dan Wilson, p.g.a., Rami Malek, Joel B.

Visit SimpliSafe dot com slash BAILEY to customize yours. There’s No Safe Like SimpliSafe.\n\n_________\n\n*LAST CHANCE* ... tickets are available until November 12th to watch a replay of MURDER MYSTERY & MAKEUP - A Live Digital Premiere over to https://moment.co/mmm.\n\nI aired my first ever live event on October 15. And it's honestly really hard to explain how much fun it all was. We laughed, we got spiritual and I shared some things I've never really talked about before. Vulnerability! Thank you, to everyone, who bought tickets and joined me. I'll never forget this experience.\n\nNow... if you missed the event... don't you worry. I got you. For the next 28 days, you can still buy a ticket to watch MMM Live. Now why would you buy a ticket to a live event that is no longer live, you ask? Good question.\n\nWell... this is an exclusive episode that cannot be seen anywhere else. Including YouTube. After November 12th... this story, all the hot gos and insider makeup tips are... POOF... gone forever.\n\n***GET TICKETS at https://moment.co/mmm***\n\nThis was a one night only event you don't want to miss and it cannot be seen anywhere else but Moment by Patreon.\n\n_________\n\nHi friends, happy Monday!\n\nHow far would you go for love? Well... for one woman named Dolly... there was no such thing as \"too far.\" I mean... I gotta hand it to her. This woman knew what she wanted romantically and she went and got it.\n\nBut at a certain point, Dolly's thirst for steamy, sultry romance turned into something much more sinister. And a whole bunch of men got caught up in her web of destruction.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:03 - EARLY LIFE & MARRIAGE\n07:00 - DOLLY TAKES A LOVER\n10:17 - THE ATTIC CONDITIONS & FRED'S SUSPICIONS \n12:04 - THE MOVE TO L.A.\n14:18 - MOMENT!\n16:18 - A FATEFUL FIGHT\n19:44 - THE GRIEVING WIDOW'S STORY COLLAPSES\n23:30 - OTTER'S CONFESSION & DOLLY'S CHARGES\n26:24 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  :\n\nFACE\n\n-Neogen Calming Micellar Cleansing Oil\nhttps://bit.ly/4fjeXrs\n\n-Neogen Calming Cicatree Micellar Cleansing Foam\nhttps://howl.link/t160aamhz496r\n\n-Neogen Bio-Peel + Gauze Peeling Wine\nhttps://howl.link/okje9m9bfp93u\n\n-Neogen Hyal Glow Rose Essence\nhttps://howl.link/mkmh6y00qic30\n\n-Neogen Real Heartleaf Soothing Daily Mask\n\u200b\u200bhttps://howl.link/qdguzzg8w6bms\n\n-d’Alba White Truffle Double Serum & Cream\nhttps://howl.link/75265zpoki922\n\nEYES\n\n-Neogen Extra Clear Eye Remover\nhttps://bit.ly/3O2RjDq\n\n-Peter Thomas Roth 24K Gold Hydra-Gel Eye Patches\nhttps://howl.link/vxjpi07ua6qg5\n\n-Saturday Skin Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream\nhttps://howl.link/gzwu379dm0qwl\n\nLIPS\n\n-La Roch-Posay Cicaplast Lips Hydration Restore Lip Balm\nhttps://howl.link/e8mdfq4w0s3f7",

Visit SimpliSafe dot com slash BAILEY to customize yours. There’s No Safe Like SimpliSafe.\n\n_________\n\n*LAST CHANCE* ... tickets are available until November 12th to watch a replay of MURDER MYSTERY & MAKEUP - A Live Digital Premiere over to https://moment.co/mmm.\n\nI aired my first ever live event on October 15. And it's honestly really hard to explain how much fun it all was. We laughed, we got spiritual and I shared some things I've never really talked about before. Vulnerability! Thank you, to everyone, who bought tickets and joined me. I'll never forget this experience.\n\nNow... if you missed the event... don't you worry. I got you. For the next 28 days, you can still buy a ticket to watch MMM Live. Now why would you buy a ticket to a live event that is no longer live, you ask? Good question.\n\nWell... this is an exclusive episode that cannot be seen anywhere else. Including YouTube. After November 12th... this story, all the hot gos and insider makeup tips are... POOF... gone forever.\n\n***GET TICKETS at https://moment.co/mmm***\n\nThis was a one night only event you don't want to miss and it cannot be seen anywhere else but Moment by Patreon.\n\n_________\n\nHi friends, happy Monday!\n\nHow far would you go for love? Well... for one woman named Dolly... there was no such thing as \"too far.\" I mean... I gotta hand it to her. This woman knew what she wanted romantically and she went and got it.\n\nBut at a certain point, Dolly's thirst for steamy, sultry romance turned into something much more sinister. And a whole bunch of men got caught up in her web of destruction.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:03 - EARLY LIFE & MARRIAGE\n07:00 - DOLLY TAKES A LOVER\n10:17 - THE ATTIC CONDITIONS & FRED'S SUSPICIONS \n12:04 - THE MOVE TO L.A.\n14:18 - MOMENT!\n16:18 - A FATEFUL FIGHT\n19:44 - THE GRIEVING WIDOW'S STORY COLLAPSES\n23:30 - OTTER'S CONFESSION & DOLLY'S CHARGES\n26:24 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  :\n\nFACE\n\n-Neogen Calming Micellar Cleansing Oil\nhttps://bit.ly/4fjeXrs\n\n-Neogen Calming Cicatree Micellar Cleansing Foam\nhttps://howl.link/t160aamhz496r\n\n-Neogen Bio-Peel + Gauze Peeling Wine\nhttps://howl.link/okje9m9bfp93u\n\n-Neogen Hyal Glow Rose Essence\nhttps://howl.link/mkmh6y00qic30\n\n-Neogen Real Heartleaf Soothing Daily Mask\n\u200b\u200bhttps://howl.link/qdguzzg8w6bms\n\n-d’Alba White Truffle Double Serum & Cream\nhttps://howl.link/75265zpoki922\n\nEYES\n\n-Neogen Extra Clear Eye Remover\nhttps://bit.ly/3O2RjDq\n\n-Peter Thomas Roth 24K Gold Hydra-Gel Eye Patches\nhttps://howl.link/vxjpi07ua6qg5\n\n-Saturday Skin Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream\nhttps://howl.link/gzwu379dm0qwl\n\nLIPS\n\n-La Roch-Posay Cicaplast Lips Hydration Restore Lip Balm\nhttps://howl.link/e8mdfq4w0s3f7"

I talk about heat pumps a lot. They really are the most energy efficient way to heat and cool things, but the study of caloric cooling represents the potential for a new, solid-state-esque approach to managing heat. Yup, solid state. That comes with the possibility of achieving significantly higher efficiencies without refrigerants. Caloric cooling holds massive implications for the way we cool our homes, our vehicles, and maybe even ourselves. So, how does it all work? And why does it have the potential to completely change climate control?\n\nSome images are courtesy of Saarland University - Oliver Dietze\n\nWatch Why The US Military Chose Silicon-Graphene Batteries https://youtu.be/l60hjFvj64s?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/how-solid-state-cooling-could-change-everything/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/solar-guide\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio version - http://bit.ly/stilltbdfm\n\nJoin the Undecided Discord server:\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/discord\n\n👋 Support Undecided on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mattferrell\n\n\n⚙️ Gear & Products I Like\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/shop/\n\nVisit my Energysage Portal (US):\nResearch solar panels and get quotes for free!\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/energysage\n\nAnd find heat pump installers near you (US):\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/energysage-heatpumps\n\nOr find community solar near you (US):\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/community-solar\n\nFor a curated solar buying experience (Canada)\nEnergyPal's free personalized quotes:\nhttps://energypal.com/undecided\n\nTesla Referral Code:\nGet 1,000 free supercharging miles \nor a discount on Tesla Solar & Powerwalls\nhttps://ts.la/matthew84515\n\n\n👉 Follow Me\nMastodon\nhttps://mastodon.social/@mattferrell\n\nX\nhttps://twitter.com/mattferrell\nhttps://twitter.com/undecidedMF\n\nMastodon\nhttps://mastodon.social/@mattferrell\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mattferrell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/undecidedmf\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/undecidedMF/\n\nWebsite\nhttps://undecidedmf.com\n\n\n📺 YouTube Tools I Recommend\nAudio file(s) provided by Epidemic Sound\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedEpidemic\n\nTubeBuddy\nhttps://www.tubebuddy.com/undecided\n\nVidIQ\nhttps://vidiq.com/undecided\n\n\nI may earn a small commission for my endorsement or recommendation to products or services linked above, but I wouldn't put them here if I didn't like them.

            "description": "How Solid State Cooling Could Change Everything. Use code 50UNDECIDED to get 50% OFF plus free shipping on your first Factor box at https://bit.ly/3BRkS87! I talk about heat pumps a lot. They really are the most energy efficient way to heat and cool things, but the study of caloric cooling represents the potential for a new, solid-state-esque approach to managing heat. Yup, solid state. That comes with the possibility of achieving significantly higher efficiencies without refrigerants. Caloric cooling holds massive implications for the way we cool our homes, our vehicles, and maybe even ourselves. So, how does it all work? And why does it have the potential to completely change climate control?\n\nSome images are courtesy of Saarland University - Oliver Dietze\n\nWatch Why The US Military Chose Silicon-Graphene Batteries https://youtu.be/l60hjFvj64s?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/how-solid-state-cooling-could-change-everything/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/solar-guide\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio version - http://bit.ly/stilltbdfm\n\nJoin the Undecided Discord server:\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/discord\n\n👋 Support Undecided on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mattferrell\n\n\n⚙️ Gear & Products I Like\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/shop/\n\nVisit my Energysage Portal (US):\nResearch solar panels and get quotes for free!\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/energysage\n\nAnd find heat pump installers near you (US):\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/energysage-heatpumps\n\nOr find community solar near you (US):\nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/community-solar\n\nFor a curated solar buying experience (Canada)\nEnergyPal's free personalized quotes:\nhttps://energypal.com/undecided\n\nTesla Referral Code:\nGet 1,000 free supercharging miles \nor a discount on Tesla Solar & Powerwalls\nhttps://ts.la/matthew84515\n\n\n👉 Follow Me\nMastodon\nhttps://mastodon.social/@mattferrell\n\nX\nhttps://twitter.com/mattferrell\nhttps://twitter.com/undecidedMF\n\nMastodon\nhttps://mastodon.social/@mattferrell\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mattferrell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/undecidedmf\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/undecidedMF/\n\nWebsite\nhttps://undecidedmf.com\n\n\n📺 YouTube Tools I Recommend\nAudio file(s) provided by Epidemic Sound\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedEpidemic\n\nTubeBuddy\nhttps://www.tubebuddy.com/undecided\n\nVidIQ\nhttps://vidiq.com/undecided\n\n\nI may earn a small commission for my endorsement or recommendation to products or services linked above, but I wouldn't put them here if I didn't like them.
